<p>Investigate allows you to learn about a phenomenon that occurs in someone else. Use it when an idea or behavior someone is presenting seems poor, confusing, or simply interesting.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Act as if you were a detached but fascinated inquirer, asking questions until your curiosity is satisfied or you no longer want to ask questions.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Ask well-formed questions.</li>
  <li>Ask only questions that will increase your understanding.</li>
  <li>Ask questions only if the subject is engaged and appears ready to answer more.</li>
  <li>Refrain from offering opinions.</li>
  <li>Do not ask leading questions where you think you know how he or she will answer.</li>
  <li>If you cannot remain a detached, curious investigator with no agenda, stop using the protocol until you can come back to it and keep these commitments.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Do not theorize about the subject or provide any sort of diagnosis.</li>
  <li>Consider using the following forms for your questions:
    <ul>
      <li>What about X makes you Y Z?</li>
      <li>Would you explain a specific example?</li>
      <li>How does X go when it happens?</li>
      <li>What is the one thing you want most from solving X?</li>
      <li>What is the biggest problem you see regarding X now?</li>
      <li>What is the most important thing you could do right now to help you with X?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Ineffective queries include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Questions that lead or reflect an agenda.</li>
      <li>Questions that attempt to hide an answer you believe is true.</li>
      <li>Questions that invite stories.</li>
      <li>Questions that begin with “Why.”</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Stick to your intention of gathering more information.</li>
  <li>If you feel that you will explode if you can’t say what’s on your mind, you shouldn’t speak at all. Consider <a href="/core-protocols/en/intention-check">checking your intention</a> or <a href="/core-protocols/en/checkout">Check Out</a>.</li>
