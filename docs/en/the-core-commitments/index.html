<ol>
  <li>I commit to engage when present.
    <ul>
      <li>(a) To know and disclose
        <ul>
          <li>what I want,</li>
          <li>what I think, and</li>
          <li>what I feel.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(b) To always seek effective help.</li>
      <li>(c) To decline to offer and refuse to accept incoherent emotional transmissions.</li>
      <li>(d) When I have or hear a better idea than the currently prevailing idea, I will immediately either
        <ul>
          <li>propose it for decisive acceptance or rejection, and/or explicitly seek its improvement.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>(e) I will personally support the best idea regardless of its source,
        <ul>
          <li>however much I hope an even better idea may later arise, and</li>
          <li>when I have no superior alternative idea.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I will seek to perceive more than I seek to be perceived.</li>
  <li>I will use teams, especially when undertaking difficult tasks.</li>
  <li>I will speak always and only when I believe it will improve the general results/effort ratio.</li>
  <li>I will offer and accept only rational, results-oriented behavior and communication.</li>
  <li>I will disengage from less productive situations
    <ul>
      <li>(a) When I cannot keep these commitments,</li>
      <li>(b) When it is more important that I engage elsewhere.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I will do now what must be done eventually and can effectively be done now.</li>
  <li>I will seek to move forward toward a particular goal, by biasing my behavior toward action.</li>
  <li>I will use the Core Protocols (or better) when applicable.
    <ul>
      <li>(a) I will offer and accept timely and proper use of the <a href="/core-protocols/en/protocol-check">Protocol Check</a> protocol without prejudice.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>I will neither harm—nor tolerate the harming of—anyone for his or her fidelity to these commitments.</li>
  <li>I will never do anything dumb on purpose.</li>
