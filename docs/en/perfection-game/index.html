<p>The Perfection Game protocol will support you in your desire to aggregate the best ideas. Use it whenever you desire to improve something you’ve created.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Perfectee performs an act or presents an object for perfection, optionally saying “Begin” and “End” to notify the Perfector of the start and end of the performance.</li>
  <li>Perfector rates the value of the performance or object on a scale of 1 to 10 based on how much value the Perfector believes he or she can add.</li>
  <li>Perfector says “What I liked about the performance or object was X,” and proceeds to list the qualities of the object the Perfector thought were of high quality or should be amplified.</li>
  <li>Perfector offers the improvements to the performance or object required for it to be rated a 10 by saying “To make it a ten, you would have to do X.”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Accept perfecting without argument.</li>
  <li>Give only positive comments: what you like and what it would take to “give it a 10.”</li>
  <li>Abstain from mentioning what you don’t like or being negative in other ways.</li>
  <li>Withhold points only if you can think of improvements.</li>
  <li>Use ratings that reflect a scale of improvement rather than a scale of how much you liked the object.</li>
  <li>If you cannot say something you liked about the object or specifically say how to make the object better, you must give it a 10.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>A rating of 10 means you are unable to add value, and a rating of 5 means you will specifically describe how to make the object at least twice as good.</li>
  <li>The important information to transmit in the Perfection Game protocol improves the performance or object. For example, “The ideal sound of a finger snap for me is one that is crisp, has sufficient volume, and startles me somewhat. To get a 10, you would have to increase your crispness.”</li>
  <li>As a perfectee, you may only ask questions to clarify or gather more information for improvement. If you disagree with the ideas given to you, simply don’t include them.</li>
</ul>
