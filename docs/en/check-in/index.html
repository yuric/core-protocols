<p>Use Check In to begin meetings or anytime an individual or group Check In would add more value to the current team interactions.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Speaker says “I feel [one or more of MAD, SAD, GLAD, AFRAID].” Speaker may provide a brief explanation. Or if others have already checked in, the speaker may say “I pass.” (See the Pass protocol.)</li>
  <li>Speaker says “I’m in.” This signifies that Speaker intends to behave according to the Core Commitments.</li>
  <li>Listeners respond, “Welcome.”</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>State feelings without qualification.</li>
  <li>State feelings only as they pertain to yourself.</li>
  <li>Be silent during another’s Check In.</li>
  <li>Do not refer to another’s Check In disclosures without explicitly granted permission from him or her.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>In the context of the Core Protocols, all emotions are expressed through combinations of MAD, SAD, GLAD, or AFRAID. For example, “excited” may be a combination of GLAD and AFRAID.</li>
  <li>Check In as deeply as possible. Checking in with two or more emotions is the norm. The depth of a group’s Check In translates directly to the quality of the group’s results.</li>
  <li>Do not do anything to diminish your emotional state. Do not describe yourself as a “little” mad, sad, glad, or afraid or say “I’m mad, but I’m still glad.”</li>
  <li>Except in large groups, if more than one person checks in, it is recommended that all do so.</li>
  <li>HAPPY may be substituted for GLAD, and SCARED may be substituted for AFRAID.</li>
</ul>
