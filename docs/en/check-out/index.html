<p>Check Out requires that your physical presence always signifies your engagement. You must Check Out when you are aware that you cannot maintain the <a href="/core-protocols/en/the-core-commitments">Core Commitments</a> or whenever it would be better for you to be elsewhere.</p>

<h2 id="steps">Steps</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Say “I’m checking out.”</li>
  <li>Physically leave the group until you’re ready to Check In once again.</li>
  <li>Optionally, if it is known and relevant, you can say when you believe you’ll return.</li>
  <li>Those who are present for the Check Out may not follow the person, talk to or about the person checking out or otherwise chase him or her.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="commitments">Commitments</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Return as soon as you can and are able to keep the <a href="/core-protocols/en/the-core-commitments">Core Commitments</a>.</li>
  <li>Return and Check In without unduly calling attention to your return.</li>
  <li>Do not judge, shame, hassle, interrogate, or punish anyone who checks out.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="notes">Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>When you Check Out do it as calmly and gracefully as possible so as to cause minimal disruption to others.</li>
  <li>Check Out if your emotional state is hindering your success, if your receptivity to new information is too low, or if you do not know what you want.</li>
  <li>Check Out is an admission that you are unable to contribute at the present time.</li>
</ul>
